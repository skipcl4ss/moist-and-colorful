# moist-and-colorful
A team project that I participated in a year ago and was responsible  for the coding part, It is an Arduino-powered machine that measures the moisture of some soil and represents the level of moisture on five colored LEDs. We were going to use an LCD screen but found the LED bulbs idea to be more practical.
